# JavaScript Server

This project demonstrates how to create a simple server using JavaScript with Node.js. It explains the concept of a server in JavaScript and how to build and run one with the help of the `http` module.

## What is a Server in JavaScript?

A server is a system or program that listens for incoming requests from clients (such as web browsers) and responds to them accordingly. In the context of JavaScript, a server can be created using Node.js, a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Node.js provides the `http` module, which enables you to create a server that listens to HTTP requests, processes them, and sends back appropriate responses.

## Setting up the Project
